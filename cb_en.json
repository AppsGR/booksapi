Lewis died fifty years ago this year. “More than a generation after his death, Lewis’s works are now more popular and widely read than at any point during his lifetime.”1 His thought is so creative and so profound and so extensive that Alister McGrath says, “Half a century after his death, the process of receiving and interpreting Lewis has still only begun.”2 I put Lewis in the top three writers who have influenced how I read and respond to the world. Yes, the world is a book to be read. And few people could read like Lewis. When Clyde Kilby wrote an anthology of Lewis’s writings he titled it A Mind Awake. He might have called it “An Awakening Mind.” This is the effect it has. His alertness to reality is contagious. My tribute to Lewis is scattered all through my writings and sermons. I want to thank Jonathan Parnell for gathering together all the parts of this book and providing the editorial sutures that transform them into a readable flow. This is our celebration of Lewis’s extraordinary gift of being Awake to Wonder."

John Piper finished his devotions, slid on his boots, bundled in his coat, and stepped outside to the remnants of an overnight ice storm to walk 600 slippery steps from his Minneapolis home to the door of Bethlehem Baptist Church for the weekly prayer gathering. The gatherings were typically small, sometimes only three or four attended, but two or three is enough of an audience to pray for the congregation’s needs and the gospel’s advance. Just one week earlier, Piper took a different walk. Under the warm spotlight of Atlanta’s Georgia Dome for Passion 2013, Piper climbed the stairs and walked on stage to plead with 60,000 college students to embrace the beauty of Christ as they face a future of inevitable suffering and persecution in various forms. His bold voice echoed through the dome, reiterating the point of the conference. “This is what Passion is about,” he said, “the glorification of the infinite worth of Jesus so that he remains our joy when everything around our soul gives way” (Heb. 10:34).

I recorded these little duets three years before he died. It has been a sweet afternoon. I wish I had felt at 17 what I feel at 67. I wish I had known and felt the value of a father’s Song. I wish I had sung with him earlier, just the two of us. Perhaps some young son reading this will ask the Lord Jesus to take away the immature embarrassment at his father’s Song—the Song of his life. My father was an evangelist-poet-singer-songwriter. I have in front of me a folder with the lyrics and the musical scores that he wrote. Five of these are the actual pre-lined music paper where he drew in the notes and printed by hand the lyrics between the treble and bass clefs. There are titles like “I’m in Debt to Jesus,” “Christ Is the Answer,” “Thy Hand upon Me, Lord,” “Take Time to Pray,” and “Lord, Make Me Pure.” One, called “His Grace Is Sufficient,” is printed with the words “Copyright, 1943, by William S. H. Piper” in the bottom margin."

In this case, Jonathan Parnell did most of the heavy lifting, but my gratitude overflows to all. They conceived of this collection and, along with Justin Taylor’s gracious contributions, made it a reality. All I did was help title the chapters and write this preface. They gathered my thoughts from many sources and put them together here. When I look back over the years covered by this collection, I realize with fresh intensity the pervasive impact on me of Edwards’s vision of God. Without Edwards, I am not sure the phrase “God-entranced” would have the meaning for me it does. This is an indictment of my soul. For someone should ask, Isn’t the Bible enough to make you God-entranced? The true answer is that it should be."

Everyone must get up and walk through the routines of making break- fast, and washing clothes, and going to work, and paying bills, and discipling children. We must, in general, keep life going when the heart is breaking. But it’s different with pastors—not totally different, but different. The heart is the instrument of our vocation. Charles Spurgeon said, “Ours is more than mental work—it is heart work, the labour of our inmost soul.”1 When a pastor’s heart is breaking, therefore, he must labor with a broken instrument. Preaching is the pastor’s main work, and preaching is heart work, not just mental work. The question becomes, then, not just how you keep living when the marriage is blank, or when the finances don’t reach, or when the pews are bare and friends forsake you; but, How do you keep preaching?"

They affect joints, bones, nervous systems, lungs, hearts, and brains. And even in the United States—a country that leads the world in medical innovation and technology—roughly 20% of its citizens live with a disability. No church is immune, so every church leader must be pre- pared. Disability raises some of the most fundamental questions about the goodness and sovereignty of God a pastor will ever face. And often these questions are raised by people experiencing significant suffering. Does God have a good design in my disability? To this hard question God is not silent. But for us to hear from him requires that we submit our hearts to his word to learn from him. And that is the aim of this collection of ser- mons and interviews from the ministry of John Piper."

The issue hit newsstands and re-ignited a longstanding mommy war in American culture. We were ready to respond from a Christian perspective at desiring- God.org—but only barely. Ten months earlier (July 2011), when our blog was just beginning to take shape and we had no regular female contributors, writer and mother of six, Rachel Jankovic (Idaho), wrote and emailed a submission to us in a Word doc. We pasted it into a blog post, gave it a simple tit- le—“Motherhood Is a Calling (And Where Your Children Rank)”—and hit publish. We simply posted the text and added no image, no color, no visual flair. Despite its minimalism, the post spread virally immediately, and the initial momentum swelled for months. A full three years later, the post has been ‘liked’ on Facebook over 100,000 times and viewed over 500,000 times, both records for anything published on the Desiring God blog. The post now averages 180 visits every day."

This is the starting place for any serious topical focus: to have the view of his greatness before us and to be swallowed up by it. The Lord — the triune God whose essence we can’t divide and whose persons we can’t blend. He is utterly in- dependent, gloriously sovereign, never arbitrary. This is precisely the reason we exist, that we might enjoy him, to his glory. And that’s why sanctification matters. God has designed that the salvation of his people not only involve his unconditional election and Jesus’s redemptive triumph, but also the perfecting work of his Spirit — a work that seeps down into the nitty-gritty of our lives and wields the gospel’s victory one swing at a time."

The theme is “Brothers, We Are Still Not Professionals: Reclaim- ing the Centrality of the Supernatural in Ministry.” Just days prior to the conference is the scheduled release of John Piper’s revised and expanded book Brothers, We Are Not Professionals: A Plea to Pastors for Radical Ministry. This short ebook is a celebration and extension of that book—born not only from an effort to whet the appetite for the coming conference, but in a hope to bless pastors and other Christian leaders beyond the book and conference. In October 2012, Desiring God issued invitations to a hand- ful of ministry friends—all of them seasoned pastors whom we deeply respect—to contribute to this ebook. As the chapters came in, we posted them at the Desiring God blog; now that they’ve all arrived, we are publishing them together in one place as a resource we hope might have a long electronic shelf life."

Skillful listening is a non-negotiable skill for everyone who enters a church building on Sunday or plays a sermon through headphones during the week. The life and health and growth of our souls are tied to how well we listen. We are wise to periodically evaluate our own hearing of God’s word. If we listen with carelessness, we can drift away from God. On the other hand, if we listen with vigilance we “swim against the stream of sin and indifference.” “Don’t be cavalier in the hearing of God’s Word week af- ter week,” John Piper cautions us. “If it is not softening and saving and healing and bearing fruit, it is probably harden- ing and blinding and dulling.” It is too easy to slip into what Scripture calls “dullness of hearing,” to hear the weekly ser- mons without faith, and to see little or no moral fruit in our lives as a result. As Jesus makes clear, ultimately it is how we hear that reveals who we are (John 8:43, 47, 10:4, 27)."

The answer to where God wants people to be is in a spiritual condition and lifestyle that display his glory and honor his name. Therefore, the goal of spiritual leadership is that people come to know God and to glorify him in all that they do. Spiritual leadership is aimed not so much at directing people as it is at changing people. If we would be the kind of leaders we ought to be, we must make it our aim to develop persons rather than dictate plans. You can get people to do what you want, but if they don’t change in their heart you have not led them spiritually. You have not taken them to where God wants them to be."

For more than two centuries after its first publication, The Pilgrim’s Progress ranked just behind the King James Bible as the most important book in evangelical Protestant households. The book has been translated into some two hundred languages, including eighty in Africa. Any book that has achieved such popularity has a very large claim to our attention. Facts of Publication The Pilgrim’s Progress actually has two publication dates, corresponding to the two books that comprise it. The first book was published in 1678 and bore the title The Pilgrim’s Progress: From This World to That Which Is to Come, Delivered Under the Similitude of a Dream. It tells the story of the spiritual journey of the protagonist named Christian from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City (meaning heaven)."

Comparatively few whaling ships know of Moby-Dick, and fewer yet have encountered him. In a previous encounter, the whale destroyed Ahab's boat and bit off his leg. Ahab intends to exact revenge."

Its representation of the underside of domestic life and the hypocrisy behind religious enthusiasm drew both praise and bitter criticism, while Charlotte Brontë's striking expose of poor living conditions for children in charity schools as well as her poignant portrayal of the limitations faced by women who worked as governesses sparked great controversy and social debate. Jane Eyre, Brontë's best-known novel, remains an extraordinary coming-of-age narrative, and one of the great classics of literature."

The story tells the adventures of the wandering sailor Ishmael and his voyage on the whaling ship Pequod, commanded by Captain Ahab. Ishmael soon learns that Ahab seeks one specific whale, Moby-Dick, a white whale of tremendous size and ferocity. Comparatively few whaling ships know of Moby-Dick, and fewer yet have encountered him. In a previous encounter, the whale destroyed Ahab's boat and bit off his leg. Ahab intends to exact revenge."

Today, the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers."

Its representation of the underside of domestic life and the hypocrisy behind religious enthusiasm drew both praise and bitter criticism, while Charlotte Brontë's striking expose of poor living conditions for children in charity schools as well as her poignant portrayal of the limitations faced by women who worked as governesses sparked great controversy and social debate. Jane Eyre, Brontë's best-known novel, remains an extraordinary coming-of-age narrative, and one of the great classics of literature."
