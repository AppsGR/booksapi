Lewis died fifty years ago this year. “More than a genera- tion after his death, Lewis’s works are now more popular and widely read than at any point during his lifetime.”1 His thought is so creative and so profound and so extensive that Alister McGrath says, “Half a century after his death, the process of receiving and interpreting Lewis has still only begun.”2\nI put Lewis in the top three writers who have influenced how I read and respond to the world. Yes, the world is a book to be read. And few people could read like Lewis. When Clyde Kilby wrote an anthology of Lewis’s writings he titled it A Mind Awake. He might have called it “An Awakening Mind.” This is the effect it has. His alertness to reality is contagious.\nMy tribute to Lewis is scattered all through my writings and sermons. I want to thank Jonathan Parnell for gathering togeth- er all the parts of this book and providing the editorial sutures that transform them into a readable flow. This is our celebration of Lewis’s extraordinary gift of being Awake to Wonder."

                        "description": "Friday morning, January 11, 2013 dawned frigid and dark in Minneapolis. John Piper finished his devotions, slid on his boots, bundled in his coat, and stepped outside to the remnants of an overnight ice storm to walk 600 slippery steps from his Minneapolis home to the door of Bethle- hem Baptist Church for the weekly prayer gathering. The gatherings were typically small, sometimes only three or four attended, but two or three is enough of an audience to pray for the congregation’s needs and the gospel’s advance.\nJust one week earlier, Piper took a different walk. Under the warm spotlight of Atlanta’s Georgia Dome for Passion 2013, Piper climbed the stairs and walked on stage to plead with 60,000 college students to embrace the beauty of\nChrist as they face a future of inevitable suffering and per- secution in various forms. His bold voice echoed through the dome, reiterating the point of the conference. “This is what Passion is about,” he said, “the glorification of the infinite worth of Jesus so that he remains our joy when everything around our soul gives way” (Heb. 10:34).

I recorded these little duets three years before he died. It has been a sweet afternoon.\nI wish I had felt at 17 what I feel at 67. I wish I had known and felt the value of a father’s Song. I wish I had sung with him earlier, just the two of us. Perhaps some young son reading this will ask the Lord Jesus to take away the immature embarrass- ment at his father’s Song—the Song of his life.\nMy father was an evangelist-poet-singer-songwriter. I have in front of me a folder with the lyrics and the musical scores that he wrote. Five of these are the actual pre-lined music paper where he drew in the notes and printed by hand the lyrics between the treble and bass clefs.\nThere are titles like “I’m in Debt to Jesus,” “Christ Is the Answer,” “Thy Hand upon Me, Lord,” “Take Time to Pray,” and “Lord, Make Me Pure.” One, called “His Grace Is Suffi-\ncient,” is printed with the words “Copyright, 1943, by William S. H. Piper” in the bottom margin."

In this case, Jonathan Parnell did most of the heavy lifting, but my gratitude overflows to all. They conceived of this collection and, along with Justin Taylor’s gracious contributions, made it a reality. All I did was help title the chapters and write this preface. They gathered my thoughts from many sources and put them together here.\nWhen I look back over the years covered by this col- lection, I realize with fresh intensity the pervasive impact on me of Edwards’s vision of God. Without Edwards, I am not sure the phrase “God-entranced” would have the meaning for me it does. This is an indictment of my soul. For someone should ask, Isn’t the Bible enough to make you God-entranced? The true answer is that it should be."

Everyone must get up and walk through the routines of making break- fast, and washing clothes, and going to work, and paying bills, and discipling children. We must, in general, keep life going when the heart is breaking.\nBut it’s different with pastors—not totally different, but different. The heart is the instrument of our voca- tion. Charles Spurgeon said, “Ours is more than mental work—it is heart work, the labour of our inmost soul.”1\nWhen a pastor’s heart is breaking, therefore, he must labor with a broken instrument. Preaching is the pastor’s main work, and preaching is heart work, not just mental work. The question becomes, then, not just how you keep living when the marriage is blank, or when the finances don’t reach, or when the pews are bare and friends forsake you; but, How do you keep preaching?"

They affect joints, bones, nervous systems, lungs, hearts, and brains. And even in the United States—a country that leads the world in medical innovation and technology—roughly 20% of its citizens live with a disability.\nNo church is immune, so every church leader must be pre- pared. Disability raises some of the most fundamental ques- tions about the goodness and sovereignty of God a pastor will ever face. And often these questions are raised by people experi- encing significant suffering.\nDoes God have a good design in my disability?\nTo this hard question God is not silent. But for us to hear from him requires that we submit our hearts to his word to learn from him. And that is the aim of this collection of ser-\nmons and interviews from the ministry of John Piper."

The gatherings were typically small, sometimes only three or four attended, but two or three is enough of an audience to pray for the congregation’s needs and the gospel’s advance.\nJust one week earlier, Piper took a different walk. Under the warm spotlight of Atlanta’s Georgia Dome for Passion 2013, Piper climbed the stairs and walked on stage to plead with 60,000 college students to embrace the beauty of\nChrist as they face a future of inevitable suffering and per- secution in various forms. His bold voice echoed through the dome, reiterating the point of the conference. “This is what Passion is about,” he said, “the glorification of the infinite worth of Jesus so that he remains our joy when everything around our soul gives way” (Heb. 10:34).

Ishmael soon learns that Ahab seeks one specific whale, Moby-Dick, a white whale of tremendous size and ferocity. Comparatively few whaling ships know of Moby-Dick, and fewer yet have encountered him. In a previous encounter, the whale destroyed Ahab's boat and bit off his leg. Ahab intends to exact revenge."

Its representation of the underside of domestic life and the hypocrisy behind religious enthusiasm drew both praise and bitter criticism, while Charlotte Brontë's striking expose of poor living conditions for children in charity schools as well as her poignant portrayal of the limitations faced by women who worked as governesses sparked great controversy and social debate. Jane Eyre, Brontë's best-known novel, remains an extraordinary coming-of-age narrative, and one of the great classics of literature."
